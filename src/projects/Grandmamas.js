            When I was in college, back in 2018, one of my favourite places to
            visit was Grandmama's, Juhu. A lot has changed since then. We live
            in a post pandemic world where paper menus have become rarer and
            rarer. The same is true for Grandmama's. They started using QR code
            menus but it has lost the charm the physical{" "}

              menu
            </a>{" "}
            had. So I have designed a menu preview app for Grandmama's that lets
            you view it before you get to the cafe location, but also lets you
            use the already existing QR code functionality.

            If you ever do visit Grandmama's, do try their Signature Hot
            Chocolate.
