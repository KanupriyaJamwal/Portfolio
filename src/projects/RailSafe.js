            Use of the rail networks around the world is growing fast. Railways
            and metros often wish to run more trains on the existing
            infrastructure, to carry more passengers and freight - and generate
            increased revenues. Optimizing existing infrastructure avoids the
            huge investment required for new lines and new trains. One proven
            way to achieve greater frequency of service is to use cutting edge
            technology solutions to manage rail traffic â€“ and to do it in a
            sustainable manner. Deliver a comprehensive human factors program to
            support the ground-up development of a digital communications-based
            Advanced Train Management.

            The IoT based Railway Track Monitoring System (IoT-RMS) is proposed
            for monitoring the health of the railway track. The system
            identifies any abnormality in the tracks at an early stage. These
            abnormalities are rectified before they develop for smoother
            transportation. The micro electro mechanical system accelerometers
            are placed in the axle box for measuring the signal. It becomes hard
            to identify the exact location of abnormalities when the global
            positioning system (GPS) falters due to signalling issues.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The IoT-RMS updates the location of the abnormality in the cloud and
            shares it with other trains that will be passing through that
            location. As a result, the drivers of trains respond accordingly and
            avoid derailment.

            There is the <strong>real time graph</strong> of the track status
            that monitors track health and relays the same to the control room.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            There are <strong>icons</strong> that let the driver raise an
            emergency, communicate with the control room, check schedule and
            view / update system.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Lastly, the driver can <strong>view data</strong> - date-time,
            location and track status in a box. The colour of this box will
            change according to track health status.

              While the Indian Railway system does have a setup to monitor the
              health of railway tracks, we propose simplifying data collection
              by opting for real time vibration analysis by attaching an IOT
              device to the axle of a train coach. This requires minimum manual
              effort and a low cost setup.
            </li>
            <li>
              This kind of setup is beneficial in locating the exact position of
              all trains, should the global positioning system (GPS) fail to
              work or is not accurate enough.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, we have designed easy to navigate screens for both
              train driver and control room members to access. The screens are
              intuitive and similar enough to the existing Monitoring dashboards
              so minimal training is required.

            The main constraint we had while working on this project was to
            bring viable solutions to the problem. The IOT devices needed to be
            plausibly easy to install and maintain. Even while designing UI, we
            had to consider the familiarity of drivers with using existing
            technology. Even if the technology and designs we came up with were
            futuristic, they would still fall flat when considering the existing
            user.
