            In our 6th semester of college, we had 6 subjects and one of them
            was an elective - Human Computer Interaction ðŸ˜€
            <br></br>
            This was my favourite subject and it later got me interested in UX
            Design. For our HCI project, my friend Shreya and I designed the UI
            for an ATM for kids.

          <p className="reflections col-2">
            The other elective was Operation Research.
